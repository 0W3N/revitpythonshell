# RevitPythonShell

The RevitPythonShell adds an IronPython interpreter to Autodesk Revit. 

This lets you to write plugins for Revit in Python, my favourite scripting language! But even better, it provide you with an
interactive shell that lets you see the results of your code *as you type it*. This is great for exploring the Revit API while 
writing your Revit Addins - use this in combination with the (RevitLookup)[https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup] to 
become a Revit API Ninja :)
